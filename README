Usage:

Router provides a mechanism for routing control to a handler based on the input
URI. It is very easy to setup and use. Just create an instance of type
Router. The constructor takes a handler argument which is the default handler
used when a route does not match;

    function not_found(\TCCL\Router\Router $router) {
        $router->contentType = \TCCL\Router\Router::CONTENT_TEXT;
        $router->flush();

        echo "Not found\n";
    }

    $router = \TCCL\Router\Router('not_found');

Now you can add routes using the addRoute() or addRoutesFromTable()
methods. Each route maps a request method and URI to a handler description. A
handler description identifies an executable context that can handle the route
(i.e. the handler). The canonical Router implementation supports the following
handler descriptions:

    * PHP callable

    * Class name of class that implements \TCCL\Router\RequestHandler or
      \TCCL\Router\Router

    * Object instance of class that implements \TCCL\Router\RequestHandler or
      \TCCL\Router\Router

If a RequestHandler is specified, the Router will invoke its run() method. If a
Router is specified, then the Router will pass handling to an instance of that
Router. (This is a special case that allows you to define subrouters.)

Route URIs may be exact literal routes or PHP regex strings:

    $router->addRoute('GET','/help','generate_help_page');
    $router->addRoute('GET','/\/help\/topics\/([0-9]+)/','generate_help_topic');

Any matches found upon successfully matching a regex path are set in the
router's 'matches' property:

    function generate_help_topic(\TCCL\Router\Router $router) {
        $node = $router->matches[1]; // get second match (first is entire route)

        // ...
    }

Finally we need to route the request. You will have to specify the
URI/method. This is easily obtained via the superglobals set by whatever PHP
SAPI you are using. Optionally you can specify a base path for the route. This
is useful when your application runs under a subdirectory (i.e. you won't have
to change your routes).

Here is a routing that assumes every route is relative to the document root.

    $router->route($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'],$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);

Here is routing that works under an arbitrary base path. This method assumes the
file running the routing code is under the application route directory. Be
careful if this file is a soft link referring to a file outside the application
distribution (it won't work).

    $basePath = substr(dirname(__FILE__),strlen($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']));
    $router->route($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'],$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'],$basePath);

Library Overview:

    [TCCL\Router\RequestHandler]
        run(Router $router)

    [TCCL\Router\Router]
        __construct($notFoundHandler)

            Creates a new instance with the specified fallback handler for
            non-existent routes

        addRoute($method,$uri,$handler)

            Adds a new route to the router; the handler is either a callable or
            a class name/object that implements the RequestHandler interface or
            extends the Router class.

            The $method may be an array of methods or
            \TCCL\Router\Router::HTTP_ALL for all request methods. Supported
            methods include 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'PATCH', 'HEAD' and
            'OPTIONS'.

            The $uri is either a literal string route or a regex identifying a
            set of routes to match. Any regex matches will be placed in
            $router->matches. The special route '/' identifies an exact match of
            the base path, which may or may not include a trailing '/'.

            If the handler is a Router subclass/instance, then your $uri should
            be a regex (and exception will be thrown if not). The global match
            will specify the new base path for the subrouter. This means your
            $uri should always specify the base path for the subrouter. For
            example:

                $router->addRoute(Router::HTTP_ALL,'/\/api/','APIRouter');

            In this example, $router will create a subrouter of type APIRouter
            for any path under "/api" (including "/api"). All paths in APIRouter
            will be relative to "/api".

        addRoutesFromTable(array $table)

            Adds a set of routes from the specified table into the router. This
            allows you to import a bunch of routes at once.

            The format of the $table array is an associative array that maps a
            request method to a request URI pattern to a handler
            description. For example:

                $table = ['GET' => ['/foo' => 'MyHandler']]

        route($method,$uri,$basedir)

            Routes a request with the specified method and URI

            The base directory specifies the base directory for requests; if
            this value is non-empty, then the router will interpret URIs
            relative to the base directory; for example:

                in route table:

                    "GET" "/A/B" ----> "handler1"

                route "GET" "/base/A/B" with base directory "/base":

                    execute "handler1" since "/base/A/B" matched URI "/A/B" in
                    route table

        addHeader($key,$value)

            Adds header pair to list of headers; header info must be written
            later with a call to flush()

        flush()

            Writes metadata to the output stream; this includes the response
            code, content-type and any headers

        redirect($uri,$params)

            Forces a redirect

            The URI will be evaluated relative to any configured base directory;
            as such this function SHOULD be called in a request handler after a
            call to route()

            Any parameters are encoded and appended to the URI as query parameters

        getURI($component,$params)

            Gets a URI

            The URI will have any configured base path prepended and any
            parameters appended as a query string

        getRequestType()

            Gets the request content type

            The SAPI must have provided this in $_SERVER['CONTENT_TYPE'] or
            $_SERVER['HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE']

        getRequestParam($name,$default = null)

            Gets the named request parameter, returning $default if it is not
            found.

        [protected] createHandler($handler)

            May be overridden by custom routers to provide new route handler
            description formats. A derived implementation should always call
            down into the base implementation defined in Router.

        [protected] resultHandler($result)

            Handles the result of the route handler operation (i.e. the value
            returned by a handler). The canonical implementation does nothing
            with this value; however a derived implementation can override this
            method to handle a return value in some way.

    [TCCL\Router\RouterExceptionHandling]

        Use the RouterExceptionHandling trait to add simple exception handling
        to a custom router. For example:

            class MyRouter extends \TCCL\Router\Router {
                use \TCCL\Router\RouterExceptionHandling;

                protected function handleServerError(Exception $ex) {
                    // ...
                }

                protected function handleRouterError(RouterException $ex) {
                    // ...
                }
            }

        In a handler, you can throw a RouterException, assigning the exception
        object an HTTP status code and error message. You then can support the
        handling of multiple kinds of errors in one location in your codebase.

    [TCCL\Router\RouterMethodHandling]

        Use the RouterMethodHandler trait to add method handler support to a
        custom router. This allows you to use handler descriptions like the
        following:

            "ClassName::MethodName"

        For example:

            $router->addRoute('GET','/foo','MyHandler::foo');

    [TCCL\Router\RouterRESTHandling]

        Use the RouterRESTHandling trait to add support for writing JSON-based
        REST API routers. A router that absorbs this trait will automatically
        write JSON payloads that were returned from request handlers. If NULL is
        returned from a request handler, an HTTP 204 "No Content" message is
        generated. To prevent the functionality from writing to output, return
        FALSE.

        The trait also provides basic functionality for writing JSON objects and
        other common REST API responses.
